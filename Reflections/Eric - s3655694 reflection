<p>I believe that most of what we did as a group went well. We split up the work between us well and each took on a portion of the workload. We had meetings twice a week that kept us up to date with what one another were doing and helped us to make sure that we were all completing our tasks in a timely manner and make sure we didn&rsquo;t fall behind and made it to our deadlines.</p>
<p>One problem that had occurred was that we had trouble organizing our early meetings and that they were made with very short notice. That being said, after we all got together and were having meetings together, we started to be on the same page and were all organized and working together. Surprisingly there were no issues within the group itself, everyone all pitched in and did their part, counter to what has occurred in group assignments I have been involved in previously that always had one person who was riding on the rest of the group's coattails.</p>
<p>This assignment has shown me that if you can get a group of people working together towards a common goal that you can accomplish tasks that are far too vast to complete alone. I do not believe that this will be accurately reflected in our GitHub logs, however the various notes that we worked through in MS teams have a better log of what we accomplished together with notes and updates made next to one another's work.</p>
