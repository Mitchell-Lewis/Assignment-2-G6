<h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>

<p>
An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is able to navigate and deliver a payload, Whether that be people or cargo, without the need for a human to interact with the controls. It is able to scan and detect its surroundings and react without driver intervention. With a truly autonomous vehicle, a human is not needed to perform any driving function or decision making. the first official autonomous vehicle was developed in 1977 by the Tsukaba mechanical engineering laboratory. Which used an old analogue computer, that used 2 cameras to pick up special lane markings to facilitate autonomous driving. The first autonomous road trip was in 1995 by CMU'S navlab 5, driving across America, from Pittsburgh to San Diego. Driving autonomously for all but 50 of the 2850 miles.

There are multiple levels of automation when it comes to vehicles. These range from level 0 with no automation, to level 5 with full automation, in which even a steering wheel is optional.
Level 0 means there is no automation or driver assistance. All control of the vehicle is up to the driver. Level 1 is driver assistance, where only a single automation system is present, such as cruise control. Level 2 is partial automation, where the vehicle has limited control over acceleration and steering. A human driver is still required to monitor the situation and can intervene at any time. Level 3 automation is what we have included is some high end vehicles today, such as a tesla. This is where automation can control the vehicle under the right circumstances, such as on a highway. The vehicle is able to monitor its surroundings and can avoid obstacles and collisions with other non automated vehicles and obstructions. Level 4 is where the vehicle is able to run autonomously in most situations, And is aware of its surroundings and can react to most situations. However a human driver is still required to monitor the situation. Level 5 is complete automation. This is where the vehicle can run autonomously in all situations. A driver is not required, and a steering when can even be excluded.

These days driverless cars are undergoing rapid change and development. Currently autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors to detect road markings and objects. Radar is used to detect nearby vehicles and other moving objects. allowing for the vehicle to detect if an object is moving toward or away from it. It is used mainly for collision avoidance and other features such as adaptive cruise control and blind spot detection. Lidar uses a laser to scan its surrounding and create a 3d view of the area around the vehicle. Its high accuracy and small processing requirement made it great for quickly determining immediate surroundings. The vehicle uses multiple cameras to view its surrounding and detect vehicle, people, animals and any obstruction that may enter the road way. Its also used for object recognition. such as traffic lights, emergency vehicles, construction hazards etc. GPS is used to give the car its global position and a map of its surroundings to facilitate autonomous driving. Right now the main technological innovation is image and data processing. The onboard cameras are able to gather most of the data used for driving under normal conditions. however the main drawback is the amount of raw data that needs to be processed and interpreted by the computer. This is slow and right now it is not ideal for situation that require immediate action. Machine learning and neural network will most likely be the technology that moves this forward and allow reliable cheap autonomous vehicles. The other innovation we will see is seamless communication between vehicles. Having the ability to have a direct data link to all vehicles mean that the vehicle will not have to guess what every other vehicle is doing. Saving valuable processing power.

<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

<p>
Autonomous vehicles are likely to be a world changing invention. just like electricity or the internet before it. It is set to be one of the biggest game changer in vehicle history. The ramification will be felt in just about every industry.
Just as the introduction of autopilot in aviation has made air travel the safest way to travel, The impact from global adoption of level 5 autonomous vehicles can not be understated. To be able to hop into a autonomous vehicle and have the confidence that it will be able to react to any situation and keep you safe in your travels will forever change how we use vehicles. In the private sector, it will make tasks like food delivery or package delivery much more reliable and efficient. Ride sharing services will benefit hugely from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. A customer will be able to open an app and be able to request a ride. Then to be able to step into a autonomous vehicle and be able to be delivered anywhere without having a driver will be monumental to the industry. Speaking of industry. Having automated trucking and freight delivery will facilitate a major boom in the freight industry. However all this novation and automation comes at a cost. It will put millions of people out of a job and will kill the trucking and taxi industry as we know it. The ramification of this will be immense. With millions of people now looking for jobs , unemployment will skyrocket and there will be a backlash towards autonomous vehicles. Some experts say that this will increase the divide between the rich and the poor. With wealthy people being able to enjoy the luxury of autonomous vehicles, while the poor that have been kick out of their jobs and will most likely no be able to afford the autonomous vehicles that took their jobs in the first place.

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

<p>
I think this will affect me in many ways. To be able to jump into a car and get some work or study done would be great, or to catch up on some much needed sleep. To catch a automated bus to a train station and arrive precisely on time will greatly increase my usage of the public transport system. I have insomnia and do not drive when i have been unable to sleep. With autonomous vehicles i will be able to travel allot more. If we had level 5 autonomous vehicles, i would feel a lot safer knowing that most people will be using autonomous vehicles, and that the likelihood of getting into an accident will be drastic lowered. With increased safety and reduced death toll attributed to motor vehicles, car insurance will become a lot more affordable. Currently if i am waiting on a delivery i am given a time frame of when the parcel will be dropped off at my door. With autonomous vehicles that time frame will be a lot more accurate. And i will be able to work around that time a lot better. I worry about my family driving. My mum drives almost an hour to and from work everyday, which worries me as she can come home rather tired. But with level 5 autonomous vehicles i will not have to worry about that any more. My sister works with race horses and has to both schedule deliveries and get some herself. With autonomous vehicles her workload will be significantly reduced. My grandparents live almost 2 hours away in Snowtown. They come down to Adelaide weekly and i worry about them driving so far in their old age. But with autonomous vehicle they will be able to come down 
a lot more often. I believe with the adoption of autonomous vehicles will come the rise in online purchases. My cousin works in a car dealership. I think the amount of people that will buy a car from a dealership will decrease, and i think this would make his job a lot more difficult.
