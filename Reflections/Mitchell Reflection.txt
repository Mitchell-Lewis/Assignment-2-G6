I enjoyed working with these lads. we got on well and though of some great ideas. we were able to delegate tasks effectively and everyone was able to do their part. If someone was stuck or wanted input everyone was there to help and give feedback. Everyone seemed component with their tasks and were able to complete them. The only things that i see could be improved is consistency regarding meetings. I do not think there was a meeting where everyone showed up. activity in Microsoft teams. Alto of idea were discussed at the meeting and i think discussing them in the teams chat would be beneficial. I was surprised by the willingness of the team to learn and adapt. I have learnt that i like to get things done a lot faster then everyone else. The group likes to take their time, and i need to give them that time. I do not think the github log accurately reflects our group activity. We did a lot of our parts, and our organizing on teams. I think it will be good to work with this group in the future, as we all get along and can get the work done in a timely manner.
