      <h2>Industry data</h2>

      <!-- make into infographic -->
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tom:</strong> Game Developer - Senior Software Developer, External Productions </li>
        <li><strong>Elliott:</strong> Game Developer - Senior Software Developer, External Productions </li>
        <li><strong>Oliver:</strong> Entrepreneur/Own Boss/ Free - Lancer</li>
        <li><strong>Mitch:</strong> IT support Technician  </li>
        <li><strong>Eric:</strong> Financial Planner </li>
        <li><strong>Lloyd:</strong> DevOp Engineer  </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In “Group Name” we had a variety of ideal jobs from our team members. We’ve decided to group the ideal jobs into exclusively IT related careers and into careers that use IT. We’ve grouped Game Developers, IT Support Technician and DevOp Engineer into IT exclusive career paths and Entrepreneur and Financial Planner in careers that use IT.  </p>

      <p>Looking at the career skills that are in greatest demand provided by the Burning Glass Technologies, we can see that a lot of the skills that are in demand for BGTOCC Family: Information Technology have a lot of common elements that you’d expect across almost all careers not just IT related careers so would be applicable to our members who haven’t chosen IT related careers. </p>

      <p>These common skills that would be just as applicable for a Game Developer, an Entrepreneur, an IT Support Technician or a Financial Planner, the skill in most in demand by being required by 36.3% of all posting in the Burning Glass Technologies study is Communication Skills. Good Communication Skills is required in all careers whether that be because you’re working in a team, customer facing or business facing, as long as you’re interacting with anyone being able to effectively communicate ideas and understand other people’s ideas is key to success. We also see that a lot of the other skills can be grouped under Communication Skills which further highlights how important being an effective communicator is. For example, having skills in Writing (12.8%), having Presentation Skills(3%), being Articulate(1.8%) and having good English skills (2.1%) all come under the umbrella of Communication Skills.</p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>The second highest in demand is Problem Solving which 13.4% of posting required, this is another skill that would be required across all careers whether than be a Financial Planner or DevOp Engineer. In life whether that be professional or otherwise, not everything goes your way and being able to work through any potential issues that come up and deal with the unexpected without having to be babysat is key to all careers. Again, highlighting how important Problem Solving is in careers is that a few of the other required skills can be grouped with it such as, Troubleshooting (9.4%) which by definition means solving problems and Creativity (6.1%) which is used to solve problems in perhaps new and effective ways.</p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>Moving over the IT specific skills while not all the skills will directly transfer from the IT related skills, there are still skills that are required that would be useful. Skills such as Microsoft Windows which is required by 9.8% of listing, would be useful in using a microsoft computer in being an Entrepreneur and IT Support Technician as of March 2019 over 800 million devices use Windows 10 alone (https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-says-windows-10-is-now-on-more-than-800-million-devices/). Having a good understanding of Microsoft Windows would also include having good skills in Microsoft Office which another 4.8% of postings wanted. </p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>As a team we believe that all the general skills listed on the Burning Glass Technologies study are required on some level or another. However, a few of the skills that may be required less than others could be Researching as if you do come into any troubles you might have to research a solution but our ideal roles you would like to think once we reach them we would have a clear understanding on what we need to do, Researching is in demand on 5.9%  the postings. Another less used skill could be Leadership as all our ideal jobs aren’t roles that are in charge of large teams, leadership is required in 4.2% of posting. Continuing with that the groups ideal jobs aren’t being in charge of large groups another less used skill could be Mentoring which is required in 3.7% of postings. This being said all these less used skills we believe would still be useful to have and understand to be an effective professional. </p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>Another skill that is applicable to both IT careers and IT related careers is having good knowledge of Project Management which is required by 8.2% of posting. Every endeavor you get into whether that be as a hobby or professionally can be broken down into being a project. Employers clearly in the IT industry see Project management as an essential skill, when using Project Management skills in a professional environment another skill that is looked for is understanding the Business Process which is required by 3.8% of posting.  </p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>For more IT related skills that would be applicable to the IT related careers, having and understanding in C# and Git are skills that are required for our ideal jobs related to IT. However these are skills that aren’t highly ranked on the Burning Glass study with C# only required by 6% of posting and Git only needed by 4.5% of postings. The most required skills are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA which are required by 13%, 10.7% and 10.4% respectively, these are all skills and programming languages that members of “group name” should learn to a comparable level as they are required by more than a third of the IT industries jobs. </p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>As we can see there are a lot of skills that carry over from the IT related careers to careers that are not exclusively IT related whether that be generic skills or even IT skills. The skills you need in a professional environment carry over to all careers. </p>

      <h3>Luke Wallace - luke.wallace@lendlease.com</h3>
      <div class="questions">
        Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? 
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        I work for Lendlease which is a Tier 1 construction company, I am on the design team, and we do all the ITC/Audio visual and networking design for big commercial towers, hospitals, big infrastructure projects, in every industrial sector out there. If it requires fancy technology, I am involved in it. I am in the building team division of Lendlease, we will put in for bids for big major projects like multi plex, then we will put in a gross maximum price offer based on the documentation that the client gives us. There is a lot of reading a lot of determination from understanding what tech aspirations and requirements are needed, some clients know what they want, for example hospitals, digital departments within health industry are quite advanced in requirement sets. We look at requirement sets in alignment with architectural aspirations of the building. Almost every building now has converged networks, we will put a baseline design which we would then tender if they are successful with the bid.
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        We put in a gross maximum price with the preferred construction company then if they are awarded the contract they will go and develop design briefs further and then they will come up with performance specs which we will write which will then be divided into the various work packages, generally with work packages we will either edit or review other consultancies work, they are the converged network of the base building, sometimes it involves multiple converged networks because for example some hospitals have an engineering converged network, and a clinical network so there are two layers of networks doing two different functions. They are trying to do a fully converged network so eventually converging networks reduces infrastructure footprint required for the buildings which saves money and time for large projects.
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        So, there is networking in there, some converged networking, Wi-Fi, desktop surveys, audits, estimation of how many access points are required, inbuilding mobile coverage, requires distributed antenna system that allows mobile coverage withing building, interface and integrated service platforms. The term smart building is a broad and loose term, most of the building management systems, are pretty smart, they do a lot, the integrated service platforms will bring in all the other building systems onto one platform, so you have one data aggregated platform that’s taken all the data and stored it for analytics, so the building industry is jumping ahead trying to find value out of all the data from the building from thousands and thousands of data points they produce daily that adds value to the business.
      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        So, would there be an interface that both employees and clients or visitors use that is all recorded on one system?
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        Integrated service platforms are called a single pane of glass, so basically within the building and facilities management business’s, we will build the building and hand over to operators or facility managers, sometimes give it over to the owner. Big companies that do it, JLL and spotless etc. these integrated service platforms allow them to manage all the technology and access control, security cameras etc, all from one single platform. Then we can say for commercial towers where there is multiple tenants, we can then give them access to the floors they have leased, they can then get aggregated data and understanding of their usage and utilisation. Now we have access to IOT another broad term for an internet connected device, we can put sensors in the building, these advanced workplace sensors are doing light levels, sound levels, so many other metrics involved to collect more data.
      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        Sounds very complicated.
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        It is quite stupendous how complicated it can be. Imagine a builder, that does bricks and mortar, glass, concrete, wood, carpet, that’s there frame of mind, they know they have to put in a building management system, security, HVAC so they need guys like us, technology consultants to be able to pave the way so that when they are building these buildings, so that the technology actually works, because sometimes the buildings are built and the technology doesn’t work, and they don’t understand why because there has been a gap there, in the design process.
      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        Would you primarily focus on engineering the hardware more so than the software? Or do they both go hand in hand?
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        Requires a bit of both, they go hand in hand, exactly. So, the software requires the hardware to run, so you have to size it correctly, at least with networking it is pretty much hardware, couple that with network management systems software like solar winds, then you have the standard layer 7 applications stacked to manage the networks, firewalls etc. while doing the performance specifications we are trying to be descriptive, while being high level so you have to have a very high level of understanding of network technologies per sae, even the different level of vendor offerings, every vendor does it slightly different, so when we go to tender and get responses back, we have to analyse the responses and evaluate if their offering is going to be compliant or not and to be able to give a recommendation back to the business to say yes go ahead sign this vendor up or sign this system integrator up, because they will deliver what is to be asked of them.
      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        Please tell us about the industry you work in, Is it competitive? Are there many other business’s doing the same thing at a similar level?
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        Yes, it is very competitive, the level of technology going into buildings today is above and beyond a general building consultancy, most buildings will have security, so access controls CCTV, also BMS, building management systems, that controls HVAC, hydraulics and then you have lighting etc. so you have technology consultants that are more considered as technical services consultants, which come up with some of the specifications that go out to market, which then the services team analyse and evaluate those responses. What happens in the past, all those services would be provided with their own network, because networks are now being converged due to the value add that you get from that and the flexibility from converging them, not having all these individual networks, one for lighting, one for BMS, one for security. That is sort of where our niche lies because a lot of the consultants these days are technically advanced consultancies, but we specialise in these work packages, and technology stacks that they don’t seem to do that well.
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        Audio visual is my niche, I have seen it change from standard composite video all the way now to streaming video over the internet and networks. I have seen the full evolution of that technology to today, composite video is a thing of the past, VGA is a thing of the past and now these other technology consultants are started to do their own audio-visual consultancies, and, in the past, you would have an audio-visual consultant and that’s all they would do. Now you have got these building service consultants and they are just coupling these extra value adds into their business models.
      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        Would your company go to an older building that has 10-12 systems running independently and go in and fix it? or contribute new things?
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        Yes, we do that as well, we term it greenfield and brownfield, example is cairns convention centre, basically they are doing an expansion project on that and also did a refurbishment. That is basically stripping out 20 years of old services and tech and putting in a new network based, audio-visual system, over 6 million worth of AV going into an existing building, you could imagine refurbishment and brownfields are super challenging, rarely do they go right as there are so many moving parts and so many unknowns, you may touch one thing that was meant to be retained and it breaks it, but you can’t fix it because its old so you have to replace it. Some projects you will have a brown and a greenfield so you will be building a new building, but you will need to interface with old buildings, very common with school campuses and universities. They will always have a green and a brown filed that you will have to interface with. 
      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        What other kinds of work do you have to do? 
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        A lot of the work I do is sitting on teams meeting, a lot of teams conferences, a lot of workshops, requirement gathering, on a project at the moment that we are heavily engaged in months and months of workshops trying to gather requirements from the business, getting more in depth information on technical and functional requirements, we always do technical and functional requirement registers so then when we are going to market we have got some defined requirements that the tender’s will need to respond to. 

        Sometimes I will do support, Lendlease is also a business that has technology obviously, and we will sometimes get asked to help out the IT support team and the digital team, I’ve helped them out with video conferencing aspects because that’s my niche, just helping out where you can.

      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about 
        them. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.  

      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        The It professionals are within our group particularly on the consultancy level, dealing with the IT support team is more rare but in my past roles I was part of the IT support team, In the UK I was working for Barclays, I was part of the infrastructure engineering team, we had a whole little test data centre where we could spin up hardware and software and test it out and evaluate the test, and also get penetration testing, that was almost 100% dealing with IT professionals of different experiences and skill sets. Today mostly I will deal with service managers, design managers, other consultants and then just construction managers.
      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        Are they the people just within Lendlease? Or do you deal with clients or investors?
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        The way we term client is anyone that employs our services, so Lendlease building is our client, we are also working closely with SA digital health and we are working with Macquarie bank as well, in general discussions, open discussions with them, and other consultancies, WSP is another one we are in close conversations with them about a number of projects. It’s pretty broad what I do.

        Actually, its project related so it is hard to say, some days or months will be focused on audio and visual because we will have one or two projects that have a serious AV footprint, at the moment I am working more on ISC and ISP so integrated service platforms for a commercial tower in Melbourne. So, it just depends on the project, the other portion of the time will just be helping out the bid team, doing what they call PROA, Projects, Risks, Opportunities and Assumptions, so basically, we will look at the clients’ briefs and then just say this could cost ex amount, that’s not clearly defined, and that type of stuff helps the bid trying the value manage and become more competitive while bidding. We also deal with the developers, and always spending a little bit of time across the board but generally most of the time is project related and specifically around requirements or design and then delivery.

        Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? Is it people or the computers?
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        Ha-ha, that’s a good question actually, might have to stop recording.
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        Sometimes just the business can be challenging, the business is a beast, well enterprise business is a beast, they have their own little needs and requirements of you. Sometimes I would like to just get head down thumbs up and just get focused on projects and let the business fly around you. It seems to work for me sometimes, we continuously go through restructuring, which is always a bit concerning, enterprise love restructure things every 6 months in their organisation, that can be challenging.

      <div class="questions">
        Do they have KPI’s and targets or do you get a bit of free reign?
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        That’s an interesting thing, they do say you have to set your goals, it’s not that they are challenging, the problem is that trying to achieve these goals while so busy on projects is the hard bit.
        People can be challenging, our team is pretty good, you have got to be friendly, not tough but you have to stand your ground and you have got to be honest, if something doesn’t work or you can see something isn’t going to work you have to speak up, and say I have got a concern here or we need to consider this, etc. etc. 

      </div>
      <div class="questions">
        How often would you meet people face to face, fairly regularly or is the majority online?
      </div>
      <div class ="answers">
        At the moment, never, ha-ha, this is it, this is meeting in person these days. In the past it was more regular, but obviously being a national company, it is even harder. Travel restrictions have been in place for a few years so haven’t been able to go anywhere. Before that it was quite unique to go on site and meet the project team. Sometimes I will go to the office but that’s only a couple of times a month, but there is value from working from home as well.

        <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>

          <h4>What does it do? </h4>

          <p>An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is able to navigate and deliver a payload, Whether that be people or cargo, without the need for a human to interact with the controls. It is able to scan and detect its surroundings and react without driver intervention. With a truly autonomous vehicle, a human is not needed to perform any driving function or decision making. the first official autonomous vehicle was developed in 1977 by the Tsukaba mechanical engineering laboratory. Which used an old analogue computer, that used 2 cameras to pick up special lane markings to facilitate autonomous driving. The first autonomous road trip was in 1995 by CMU'S navlab 5, driving across America, from Pittsburgh to San Diego. Driving autonomously for all but 50 of the 2850 miles. </p>
          <p>There are multiple levels of automation when it comes to vehicles. These range from level 0 with no automation, to level 5 with full automation, in which even a steering wheel is optional. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Level 0 means there is no automation or driver assistance. All control of the vehicle is up to the driver.</li>
              <li>Level 1 is driver assistance, where only a single automation system is present, such as cruise control.</li>
              <li>Level 2 is partial automation, where the vehicle has limited control over acceleration and steering. A human driver is still required to monitor the situation and can intervene at any time.  </li>
              <li>Level 3 automation is what we have included is some high end vehicles today, such as a tesla. This is where automation can control the vehicle under the right circumstances, such as on a highway. The vehicle is able to monitor its surroundings and can avoid obstacles and collisions with other non automated vehicles and obstructions.  </li>
              <li>Level 4 is where the vehicle is able to run autonomously in most situations, And is aware of its surroundings and can react to most situations. However a human driver is still required to monitor the situation.  </li>
              <li>Level 5 is complete automation. This is where the vehicle can run autonomously in all situations. A driver is not required, and a steering when can even be excluded. </li>
            </ul>
          <p>These days driverless cars are undergoing rapid change and development. Currently autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors to detect road markings and objects. Radar is used to detect nearby vehicles and other moving objects. allowing for the vehicle to detect if an object is moving toward or away from it. It is used mainly for collision avoidance and other features such as adaptive cruise control and blind spot detection. Lidar uses a laser to scan its surrounding and create a 3d view of the area around the vehicle. Its high accuracy and small processing requirement made it great for quickly determining immediate surroundings. The vehicle uses multiple cameras to view its surrounding and detect vehicle, people, animals and any obstruction that may enter the road way. Its also used for object recognition. such as traffic lights, emergency vehicles, construction hazards etc. GPS is used to give the car its global position and a map of its surroundings to facilitate autonomous driving. Right now the main technological innovation is image and data processing. The onboard cameras are able to gather most of the data used for driving under normal conditions. however the main drawback is the amount of raw data that needs to be processed and interpreted by the computer. This is slow and right now it is not ideal for situation that require immediate action. Machine learning and neural network will most likely be the technology that moves this forward and allow reliable cheap autonomous vehicles. The other innovation we will see is seamless communication between vehicles. Having the ability to have a direct data link to all vehicles mean that the vehicle will not have to guess what every other vehicle is doing. Saving valuable processing power. </p>

          <h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>

          <p>Autonomous vehicles are likely to be a world changing invention. just like electricity or the internet before it. It is set to be one of the biggest game changer in vehicle history. The ramification will be felt in just about every industry. </p>
          <p>Just as the introduction of autopilot in aviation has made air travel the safest way to travel, The impact from global adoption of level 5 autonomous vehicles can not be understated. To be able to hop into a autonomous vehicle and have the confidence that it will be able to react to any situation and keep you safe in your travels will forever change how we use vehicles. In the private sector, it will make tasks like food delivery or package delivery much more reliable and efficient. Ride sharing services will benefit hugely from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. A customer will be able to open an app and be able to request a ride. Then to be able to step into a autonomous vehicle and be able to be delivered anywhere without having a driver will be monumental to the industry. Speaking of industry. Having automated trucking and freight delivery will facilitate a major boom in the freight industry. However all this novation and automation comes at a cost. It will put millions of people out of a job and will kill the trucking and taxi industry as we know it. The ramification of this will be immense. With millions of people now looking for jobs , unemployment will skyrocket and there will be a backlash towards autonomous vehicles. Some experts say that this will increase the divide between the rich and the poor. With wealthy people being able to enjoy the luxury of autonomous vehicles, while the poor that have been kick out of their jobs and will most likely no be able to afford the autonomous vehicles that took their jobs in the first place. </p>
          <h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>
          <p>I think this will affect me in many ways. To be able to jump into a car and get some work or study done would be great, or to catch up on some much needed sleep. To catch a automated bus to a train station and arrive precisely on time will greatly increase my usage of the public transport system. I have insomnia and do not drive when i have been unable to sleep. With autonomous vehicles i will be able to travel allot more. If we had level 5 autonomous vehicles, i would feel a lot safer knowing that most people will be using autonomous vehicles, and that the likelihood of getting into an accident will be drastic lowered. With increased safety and reduced death toll attributed to motor vehicles, car insurance will become a lot more affordable. Currently if i am waiting on a delivery i am given a time frame of when the parcel will be dropped off at my door. With autonomous vehicles that time frame will be a lot more accurate. And i will be able to work around that time a lot better. I worry about my family driving. My mum drives almost an hour to and from work everyday, which worries me as she can come home rather tired. But with level 5 autonomous vehicles i will not have to worry about that any more. My sister works with race horses and has to both schedule deliveries and get some herself. With autonomous vehicles her workload will be significantly reduced. My grandparents live almost 2 hours away in Snowtown. They come down to Adelaide weekly and i worry about them driving so far in their old age. But with autonomous vehicle they will be able to come down a lot more often. I believe with the adoption of autonomous vehicles will come the rise in online purchases. My cousin works in a car dealership. I think the amount of people that will buy a car from a dealership will decrease, and i think this would make his job a lot more difficult.  </p>

      <div class="robots">

        <h3>Robots</h3>

        <h4>What does it do?  </h4>

        <p>Robots help aid humanity in various ways. From simple things around the house, to aiding in major productions at factories. They help with minor but important areas of farmwork to assist in areas of medicine and healthcare. Around the house, we can see robots in the toys that kids play with and with small vacuum robots. Within farming, robots have been developed to detect when a fruit is ripe and harvest them. Robots are also capable of detecting the location of weeds and removing them. And if you want to look closer to something more familiar, then look towards the robotic tractors that can be hooked up to the same machinery as a regular tractor. Robots also help in the production of products as they have become a major part in factories. Robots are often used in the production line to help with mass produced products as machines do not get bored much like a human would. They can be used to do a task that would be simple but a high amount would be necessary. In cases where a human touch is needed, robots can aid the human in the workload to make it easier for them. Though the production of food and physical goods is not the only way that they help in the improvement of human lifes. Robots can also be used in the medical industry. An exoskeleton can be used to help someone who has lost the ability to control their body as much as they would normally. The development of prosthetics has allowed some people to regain a limb, some being controllable with the mind. We also see robots being aids in surgery. We also see robots deployed into areas that are normally too dangerous for humans to enter. A good example of this would be the robots often used in space and sent to planets to help further aid in research. Another example would be the robots used for military purposes. When used by the military, it can be used to scout potentially dangerous areas to assess for enemies or other dangers. It can also be used to scout areas in disaster response to help save time with sending humans on the ground. In the future we will likely see further improvements in the areas above. Another would be robots in factories would be able to produce parts for their own bodys. Then with other robots, both detect where robots are damaged and repair the broken parts, in theory, allowing them to run autonomously without human intervention. What has allowed the advancement of robotics to make this possible would be the further development in artificial intelligence which gives the robots their “minds” to move on their own. Another advancement that has aided in the development in robotics is the advancement in autonomous vehicles as some robots use a similar technology as the autonomous vehicles. The development of robotics has allowed for several advantages for humanity. With the further increase in population, the need for more products both food and non food has been met with the increase productivity. Though a disadvantage of this is the loss of human jobs, forcing people if they want to keep a job, to change to what their profession is. Another limitation is that at the current moment, robots can only do what they have been programmed to do. This does mean more complex jobs require humans. Through the advancement of machine learning and greater artificial intelligence. </p>

        <h4>What is the likely impact?  </h4>

        <p>With the use of robots increasing in our daily life, the amount of products available to the increasing population can be met. Because robots can do one or a few tasks forever given they do not break down or run out of material to work with, this has allowed for greater efficiency. Because of this, robots are being used in areas and tasks that would have been mainly taken by humans. Because of this, the worry of human jobs being taken over by these robots. Though this does not mean that the amount of jobs for humans has been reduced. It just means a change of where humans are required. Robots are not at the point that they can work by themselves. Human supervision is needed as a checking to detect if there is a fault in production. Also because robots will eventually need repair, the increase in maintenance jobs has increased along with jobs to create new and better robots. Also there are still jobs that require a human touch and some people prefer products that are hand made even if the cost is more. Another change in workplaces is that medical facilities will have an increase in preference in hiring doctors and nurses that would be more familiar with the medical robotics if the facility used them. It would also see an increase in people capable of being skilled in the operation and repair the robots made for medical purposes. There would also be an increase in people working in areas other than production as their jobs would have been taken away by the robots and do not have the necessary skills or experience to shift jobs in the same field. </p>

        <h4>How will this affect you?  </h4>

        <p>With the further improvement of robotics in the medical industry, the overall health of the human population will improve. With the improvement of robotics in surgery, the likelihood of complications will decrease. With the improvement of robotics in prosthetics, it will allow for humans who have lost limbs to walk again or grab objects with their mechanical hands. With robots being used in farming, it can help improve the overall production of food without the need to hire as many people as producing the same amount without the usage of robots. The improvement with robots in production will likely improve what products are available to people while also decreasing the price of the products. For people that are still in school, robots taking over jobs will not affect them in a major way as they would be able to work with the improvement in robotics. As for the people who work in production, they could lose their jobs as the higher ups decide to replace the humans with robots and they do not have any other skills that the company would want to keep. So overall, the younger generation will likely to improve with the introduction of robotics as their jobs will likely work with it. As for the parents of those younger generations, it depends on what jobs they have and their education. For people with a good education it is not likely to affect the work security in a major way. As for the population as a whole, the improvement of life will likely improve for most members of society that the robots will reach. As for the people in rural areas, robots and the improvement will likely have little effect. </p>
